CLARITY: 

The plot is very clear to read. There's a descriptive title and clear labels to indicate what the axes represent. The caption and interpretation are very well explained.
To make it a bit clearer, there could be a legend in the plot that explains what the colors represent as well as a scale showing what the size of the dots mean as far as the number of students.

ESTHETIC: 

The plot is beautiful and makes a very interesting use of 3D. It took me a little time to understand what everyhting meant but once I did, I found that all of the information is in the plot in a very elegant way.

HONESTY: 

I think that the plot represent the data without deforming it. However, since the plot is in 3D there could be some accuracy lost because of the projection on a 2D screen. It would be interesting to see 3 separate graphs representing the relationshipds between 2 out of the 3 variables to identify the correlation.
